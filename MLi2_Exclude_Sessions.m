%Exclude_Sessions

%Idea is to have a list of sessions to skip over in analysis (so we dont
%delete the data) this could change depending on if you fix things etc

%Going to exclude the L19, W40, W41 group for now

E:\Lindsey\LRRK2_MLi2\Post_Processed\Mouse_L19
E:\Lindsey\LRRK2_MLi2\Post_Processed\Mouse_W40
E:\Lindsey\LRRK2_MLi2\Post_Processed\Mouse_W41

%implant came off on day 3- prob just exclude him totally

%For the SPINDLE stuff- if you put a minimum spindle count on it I think
%you will filter out shitty sessions, for stuff with PSDs...not sure
